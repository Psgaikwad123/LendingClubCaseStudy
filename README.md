## General Information
- Lending Club is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. 
- Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.
- The objective is to identify predictor of default so that at the time of loan application, company can use those variable for approval or rejection of loan.



 ### Steps 

 ## Data Preprocessing
- The data set consists of over 39000+ loans with 111 variables. The first step of the case study is to preprocess the data and clean it. This involves removing missing values, converting categorical variables into numerical variables, and removing unnecessary columns.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Once the data is cleaned, the next step is to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data and find insights. This includes visualizing the distribution of variables, finding the correlation between variables, and identifying the most important features.

## Conclusions
- Lending club should give loan more to borrower with 60 months tenure as the number of default is less with higher months.​
- Borrowers with high grades can be considered more preferably for issuing loan.​
- Lending club can focus more on Large business as small business prone to default more.​
- Lending club should stop giving loans to borrower with mortgage home ownership and asking for more than 12000.​
